README JSSatellites

I just started playing around with JavaScript on Khan Academy this past weekend. I don't yet know much about it, nor how to run JS programs outside of the live interpreter on the Khan Academy site, so at the moment, any files in this repo can be run through that using the following instructions:

1. Open https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs.
2. Click +Create Program.
3. Copy/paste the contents of the satellite.js file (or any other file in this repo) into the editor.
4. Observe the output in the panel on the right.

Note: I may forget to update this README file, so it's accurate as of the date this file was last modified.
